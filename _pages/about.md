I'm Andrew, an aspiring ML engineer. I'm passionate about statistical modeling and machine learning. Having been a peer tutor for half of my undergraduate education, I've also discovered a love for teaching.

I'll be matriculating to the [MSc AI](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/prospective-students/courses/pg/mai/) 2024/25 program at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) this September. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in data science in 2024 from [Yale-NUS College](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/). I'm currently interested in developing innovative AI-powered applications, particularly in the area of speech and language processing. I'm also presently pursuing a startup AI project in the area of audio tourism with classmates from Yale-NUS College.
